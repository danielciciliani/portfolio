        <p>
        I'm Daniel Ciciliani, a frontend developer <span className="font-bold">from Argentina, based in Spain.</span> I started
        building websites back in 2019 out of curiosity, <span className="font-bold">and by 2020 I was freelancing and landed
        my first job</span>, just by coding.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since then, I've worked across different industries, from advertising to retail. Lately I've also been co-founding an AI-powered startup that's still on 
        its early stages. I've focused on frontend because <span className="font-bold">I believe good UI and UX are game-changers for the user</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Now I'm looking to join a growth-driven company</span>, where I can contribute
        not just with code, but also through my strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills.
