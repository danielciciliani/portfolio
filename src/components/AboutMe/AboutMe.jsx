        <p>
          I'm Daniel Ciciliani, from Argentina. I started creating websites back in 2019,
          just out of curiosity. During the pandemic, <span className="font-bold">in 2020</span>, I began selling my
          websites as a freelancer, and that's when I made my first real money
          <span className="italic"> having fun</span>. I realized I could actually make a living just by
          coding. I was doubling my monthly income, so it felt like the right time to go all-in on
          web development, and I made a career switch. I joined Flavia Arias as a Frontend Developer during my last year in Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">In 2021 I moved to Spain</span> and started working as a Frontend Developer
          in advertising, building websites for end clients. The following year,
          I joined Grupo Juinsa, where I grew as a Frontend Developer, working
          both frontend and backend for two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, <span className="font-bold">I've been building personal projects and co-founding a
          Startup</span> that it is still on its early stages. <span className="font-bold">Now I am looking to join a
          growth-oriented company</span>, where vision and strategy are aligned with
          the product. A company where I can contribute not just with my
          technical skills but also through solid communication, collaboration,
          and problem-solving skills.
