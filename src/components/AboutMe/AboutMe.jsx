        <p>
          I'm Daniel Ciciliani and I started creating websites back in 2019,
          just out of curiosity. During the pandemic in 2020, I began selling my
          websites as a freelancer, and that's when I made my first bucks
          "having fun". I realized I could actually make a living just by
          coding, and without even noticing I made a career switch. I was
          doubling my monthly income, so it felt the right time to go all in on
          web development.

          In 2021 I moved to Spain and started working as a Frontend Developer
          in advertising, building websites for end clients. The following year,
          I joined Grupo Juinsa, where I grew as a Frontend Developer, working
          both frontend and backend for two years.

          Recently, I have been building personal projects and sharpening my
          skills to take the next step in my career. I am looking to join a
          growth-oriented company, where vision and strategy are aligned with
          the product. A company where I can contribute not just with my
          technical skills but also through solid communication, collaboration,
          and problem-solving skills.
